    "# Storing the url patterns\n",
    "- I used a hash set for the url_patterns in case I needed to access any particular url in constant time later. The generator function ties the url_patterns to the Solutions object. Doing this allows the object to be repeatedly updated with new url patterns later on if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Register url method\n",
    "- I started on the register_url method and realized I needed a way to check if a url was valid. The examples shown used a url without the scheme component. So I decided to not include that in any of my solutions as well. \n",
    "- NOTE: I could have used a python build in method to check if a string was a valid url. But I believe that would go against the goal of this question as it would trivialize creating the 'register_url' method. \n",
    "- To make the is_valid_url method I started by looking at the examples and using them to find all the rules that could be broken. Rules such as '/' must be the first character, two '/' must have a minimum distance of 1 between them, '*' had to be at the end etc. For checking allowed characters I used a hash set containing all allowed characters so that I could check if any char in the 'some_url' was not allowed in constant time complexity. \n",
    "- Time complexity is O(n) since there are only for loops and index methods with nothing nested.\n",
    "- Space complexity is O(m) m being the number of ':' present in a url since I store the indexes of the colons in 'idx' to later check if the colons had a min distance of 1 between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Match url method\n",
    "- First I use the is_valid_url method to check if url_to_match is valid. Because if the input url is not valid it will not match any patterns\n",
    "- I split the url to match by its '/' delimiter. I do the same for all patterns in the url_patterns hash map. I store these patterns in a list of lists. So now we go from '/some/url/in/here' to ['some', 'url', 'in', 'here]. I use these now list of components check if components match between url_to_match and pattern_urls\n",
    "- I realized that if the length of the pattern url does not match the length of the url_to_match then that pattern has no chance of being a correct pattern. Thus I use list comprehension to eliminate any pattern whose length does not match the input\n",
    "- I now loop through the remaining url patterns, the index 'i' represents the same component for both the url_to_match and url_pattern because their lengths are now equal. This allows me to do a comparison on a component to component basis\n",
    "- I create a temporary list called outputs. This list will store the outputs of the parameters and if the entire url matches the pattern then the temporary list will be extended to the 'output_params' and returned. However if at a later iteration we find a that a component does NOT match we will move on to the next pattern and the output lopp gets reset. This eliminates output date from failed pattern matches from leaking into the 'output_params' variable\n",
    "- if we get through the nested for loops and did not hit a return that means no patterns matched the url_to_match and thus we return 0 and the empty output_params list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test Cases\n",
    "- I thought of as many combinations of ways to break both methods. Covering a range of scenarios for valid and invalid registrations, different types of matches, and various combinations of patterns."
