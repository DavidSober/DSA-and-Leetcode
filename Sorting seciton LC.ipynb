    "An important concept in sorting is inversions. An inversion in a sequence is defined as a pair of elements that are out of order with respect to the ordering relation.

    "## Bubble Sort\n",
    "Report Issue\n",
    "Conceptually, bubble sort is an implementation of a rather simple idea. Suppose we have a collection of integers that we want to sort in ascending order. Bubble sort proceeds to consider two adjacent elements at a time. If these two adjacent elements are out of order (in this case, the left element is strictly greater than the right element), bubble sort will swap them. It then proceeds to the next pair of adjacent elements. In the first pass of bubble sort, it will process every set of adjacent elements in the collection once, making swaps as necessary. The core idea of bubble sort is it will repeat this process until no more swaps are made in a single pass, which means the list is sorted."
